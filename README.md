## Instructions
 This project is very simple, and is intended to get you familiarized
 with Git, GitHub and the GitHub Classroom system that we will be 
 using this semester.
 
 Classroom allows each of you to have a unique private GitHub repository
 that the instructor can access and view your work.  For this project
 all you will be doing is modifying the readme file (this file) to
 indicate if you were successful in compiling your project locally, 
 of if not to document your problems.
 
 Instructions
 1. In Android Studio, setup your GitHub account.
 2. Follow the GitHub classroom link that was emailed to you to.
 3. Using Android Studio's "Check out project from version control", 
 check out csc413project1 from GitHub.
 4. Compile and run the program on your machine.
 5. Run the MainActvityTest on your machine.
 6. At the very top of the readme file where incicated, write your
 name, if you could get the program compile and run, and if you could
 get the unit test run on the program.  If you had any problems, please
 describe these problems.
